<ol>

<li><b>Kafka</b></li>     
<ul><li>This is the aggregator which can get all the queries and different resources and process is accordingly </li></ul>
<li><b>Flume</b></li>
<ul>
    <li>This is the tool which can copy the log files in to Hadoop cluster. This is used for the streaming data</li>
    <li>How it is different from Kafka?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>in Kafka we are not talking about the type of the stream, it can always be the streaming data </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<li><b>MapReduce</b> </li>
<ul><li>It's a simple form of parallel Processing which can provide the data quickly </li></ul>
<li><b>Hadoop</b> </li>
